    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A really simple banana bread recipe. It's perfect for making use of old bananas. This dish is always a kid favorite.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 to 3 medium, very ripe bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>1/3 cup butter, unsalted or salted, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar - 1/2 cup less sweet, 1 cup more sweet</li>
            <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees and butter an 8x4 loaf pan</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth. Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.
                <br />
                Bake for 55 to 65 minutes at 350°F (175°C), or until a toothpick or wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. A few dry crumbs are okay; streaks of wet batter are not. If the outside of the loaf is browned but the center is still wet, loosely tent the loaf with foil and continue baking until the loaf is fully baked.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for a few minutes. Then remove the banana bread from the pan and let cool completely before serving. Slice and serve. (A bread knife helps to make slices that aren't crumbly.)</li>
        </ol>
