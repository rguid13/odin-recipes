    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is the go-to bean dip recipe. The kids eat this one up. Maybe it will make a great frozen burrito.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb. dry pinto beans</li>
            <li>1 medium onion</li>
            <li>1 medium jalepeno</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 Tbsp chili powder</li>
            <li>10-15 cranks black pepper</li>
            <li>6 cups water</li>
            <li>2-3 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spread the dry beans out onto a baking sheet to pick through them and remove any stones or bad pieces. Place the beans in a colander and rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>Dice the onion. Cut the stem off the jalapeño, slice it open lengthwise, and remove the seeds and ribs by scraping with a spoon. Dice the jalapeño and mince the garlic. Place the onion, garlic, and jalapeño in the slow cooker along with the cumin, chili powder, and black pepper. Do not add the salt.</li>
            <li>Add the sorted and rinsed beans to the slow cooker along with 6 cups of water. Stir everything to distribute the seasoning. Secure the lid and cook on high for 4-5 hours or on low for 8. It’s okay if they cook longer, they’ll just be easier to mash.</li>
            <li>After cooking, remove about 1 cup of the water and reserve it in a bowl. Mash the beans and add the reserved water back in as needed. Make the beans a little thinner in texture than you’d expect because they will thicken as they cool. Season the mashed beans with salt, beginning with one teaspoon and adding more to taste. I used approximately 1 Tbsp but add a little at a time until you’re satisfied. Serve warm!</li>
